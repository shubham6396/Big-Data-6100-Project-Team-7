Car insurance is way of avoiding a financial burden if you are ever involved in a car accident. In
US every state has a minimum amount of insurance coverage law. On top of this you need to
take out insurance on driver as well. While giving a quotation is most important part of Auto
Insurance company, they are mispriced in most of the cases which can lead to losses. By using
this data, we can find out the loss ratio which can be useful in getting more accurate quotation.
The data provided by company has various details of insurance policy like vehicle make year,
Payment Method, Vehicle Make, Performance of vehicle, Number of drivers assigned to vehicle
meaning insurance taken out on drivers for a particular car, Usage of Vehicle, Number of days
vehicle is used per week, does vehicle has anti-theft device, Vehicle age. Driver’s details are also
provided like is driver single or married, male or female, Age, Driver’s point, Age Group. Annual
premium and number of times claim is applied for, frequency and loss ratio are also provided.
Most policies have no claims but there can be some outliers where there is claim of large value.
Loss ratio is calculated by dividing total losses incurred due to claims divided by total annual
premium of policy. For every policy the annual premium changes based on the past claims and
other above factors. To calculate loss ratio for a portfolio, add up the annual premium and
losses incurred and then take out a ratio. In this project we will be working on a supervised
problem as we have a target variable which is the natural log of loss ratio of a portfolio (In_LR).
This project can help the company in setting the right amount for premium to increase the
profits of company.
